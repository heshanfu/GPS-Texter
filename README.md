# GPS-Texter
(Android) Sends a text message each time your distance from home changes by 2 km.

The program calculates distance from your home. Each time your distance is reduced by, or grows by 2 km, it sends a text message.

Please note that your carrier may charge you for each text message you send. It is advised to use this program if you have free text messages in your price plan.

Enter your home location, the phone number to send messages to and the maximum distance up to which the messages will be sent (default 50 km).

Apart from your distance from home, the program optionally may send your speed and a link to Google Maps displaying your exact location.
