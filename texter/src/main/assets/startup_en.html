<h1>Hello, GPS Texter</h1>

The program calculates distance from your home. Each time your distance is reduced by, or grows by 2 km, it sends a text message.
<br/><br/>
Your carrier may charge you for each text message you send. It is advised to use this program if you have free text messages in your price plan.
<br/><br/>
You may now dismiss this window or go directly to the settings menu by pressing a button below (recommended). You can invoke settings later by tapping the cogwheel (<img src="ic_settings_black_24dp.png">) in the upper right corner of the screen. Start using the program by entering the phone number and your home location.
